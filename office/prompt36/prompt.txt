This modern open-plan office features four white laminate workstation desks with metal legs arranged in two facing rows, each desk paired with a black mesh ergonomic task chair and a slim dual-monitor stand, with a shared low mobile pedestal drawer unit between each pair; along one side, a long light oak benching table holds three identical gray fabric desk chairs, a compact black all-in-one printer, and a small metal paper organizer tray, while a central rectangular white conference table is surrounded by six upholstered swivel meeting chairs and centered with a simple black metal desk organizer and a minimalist tray holding two small potted plants; at the far end, a black metal-framed shelving unit with wooden shelves stands next to a lockable tall filing cabinet, and a freestanding coat rack with a minimalist metal base is positioned near the entry side of the office to keep the space organized and neat.
