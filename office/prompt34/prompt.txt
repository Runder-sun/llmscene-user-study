This spacious minimalist office features a long black matte executive desk centered in the room with a low-profile black ergonomic office chair behind it, a slim dark wood credenza directly behind the chair, and two charcoal fabric guest chairs facing the desk; to one side sits a large dark wood meeting table with four black metal-framed chairs around it and a narrow black bench along one long side, while in one corner a low black leather lounge chair with a matching ottoman faces a small round black metal side table and a tall black arc floor lamp. Along one wall, a long open black metal shelving unit holds a few dark storage boxes and two minimalist black desk organizers, a slim black rolling filing cabinet is tucked under the executive desk, a compact black metal coat stand stands near the entry side, a simple black metal waste bin sits beside the desk, a dark floating console table supports a large black-framed monitor on a low stand with a slim black keyboard and mouse in front, and a small black task lamp with an adjustable arm sits at the back corner of the desk to maintain the dark, moody feel.
