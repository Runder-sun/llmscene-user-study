This industrial-style study room centers around a long, reclaimed wood desk with black metal legs placed along the back wall, holding a dual-monitor setup, a slim matte-black desk lamp on the left, and a small concrete pen holder on the right. A low-backed, dark brown leather swivel chair with a black metal base is positioned at the desk, and to its left stands a tall, open black metal bookshelf with rustic oak shelves filled with books, a few potted ferns, and woven storage baskets. In the corner near the shelf sits a compact olive-green fabric armchair with exposed metal legs, paired with a round, wire-frame side table topped with light wood, holding a ceramic mug and a small succulent. On the opposite side of the study room, a narrow metal-framed console table with a weathered wood top supports a large terracotta planter with a leafy indoor tree, a vintage-style bronze desk clock, and a shallow wooden tray organizer. Completing the layout, a movable metal filing cabinet with casters fits neatly under the right side of the main desk, a low, rectangular jute ottoman is placed near the armchair as a footrest, a black steel coat stand with wooden hooks stands nearby for bags and headphones, and a slim, tripod-style floor lamp with an exposed Edison bulb is positioned between the armchair and the bookshelf to provide warm, earthy-toned accent lighting.
