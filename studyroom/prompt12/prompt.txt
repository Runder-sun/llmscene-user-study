A spacious mid-century modern study room features a large walnut executive desk at the center with a worn leather swivel chair behind it, a slim metal desk lamp, two ceramic pencil cups, a cluttered stack of folders, a brass-framed tabletop clock, and an open laptop docking station on top; a low teak credenza runs behind the desk holding a record player, a row of vinyl records, a vintage radio, and a small potted plant, while two tall walnut bookcases packed with mismatched books, a pair of framed tabletop photos, and a couple of storage boxes stand side by side to one side of the room next to a narrow ladder-style shelving unit crowded with magazines and notebooks. A tan fabric lounge chair with a matching ottoman faces the desk with a round walnut side table between them holding a ceramic mug and a metal task lamp, a long upholstered bench with tapered wooden legs sits along one side piled with assorted cushions and a folded throw, a mobile three-drawer filing cabinet on casters tucks under one corner of the desk, a freestanding mid-century coat rack stands near the seating area stacked with bags and a jacket, and a compact bar cart with bottles and glasses is parked near the bookcases, adding to the comfortably cluttered, lived-in feel of the study room.
