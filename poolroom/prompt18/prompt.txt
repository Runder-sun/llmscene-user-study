This Billiards Room centers on a full-size, dark-stained oak pool table with a slightly worn green felt surface, surrounded by a mix of mismatched industrial-style metal stools clustered on one long side where people watch the game. A scuffed, low metal-and-reclaimed-wood bar cart is parked near one corner of the table, crowded with liquor bottles, glass tumblers, and a metal ice bucket, while a battered leather club chair with a small round metal side table sits in the far corner, angled toward the action. Along one side of the room, a long, narrow black metal console table holds an old record player, stacked vinyl records, and a few scattered cue chalks and spare cue balls, with a freestanding metal cue rack right next to it holding several cues at slightly uneven angles. Opposite the console, a compact industrial media cabinet supports a medium-sized TV and a clutter of game controllers, with a soft, overstuffed fabric loveseat in a dark charcoal color directly facing it, its arm piled with a couple of throw blankets and a loose billiard rulebook.
