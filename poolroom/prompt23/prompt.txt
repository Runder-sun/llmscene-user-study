This large Bohemian Billiards Room centers on a full-size dark-stained wooden pool table with a woven jute rug underneath, flanked on one side by a low rattan bench with earth-toned cushions and a carved wooden cue rack standing beside it, and on the other side by a pair of mismatched upholstered armchairs in muted terracotta and olive facing the table with a small round reclaimed-wood side table between them. A long live-edge console table with a set of wicker storage baskets sits behind one end of the pool table, while a vintage wooden bar cart with glass decanters stands in the far corner next to a tall potted floor plant in a clay planter, and opposite that corner a freestanding bamboo bookshelf holds stacked board games and ceramics with a woven floor pouf and a leather ottoman grouped in front for extra seating; overhead, a linear metal-and-rattan billiard light fixture hangs above the table, with a slender tripod floor lamp in natural wood placed near the seating area for softer illumination.
