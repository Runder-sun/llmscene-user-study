This small industrial dining room centers on a rectangular, weathered dark-wood dining table with a black metal frame, surrounded by four mismatched metal dining chairs and two low, backless metal stools tucked on one side. A narrow black metal bar cart with two wooden shelves stands next to the table, cluttered with bottles and stacked glass tumblers, while a compact black metal sideboard with a rustic wood top sits behind the table, holding a microwave, a coffee maker, and a small electric kettle grouped on one end. A tall, open metal shelving unit in the corner is crowded with stacked ceramic plates, bowls, and a few storage bins, with a wire fruit basket perched on the top shelf, and a freestanding industrial-style floor lamp with an exposed bulb stands beside it, angled toward the dining table. Near the entrance side of the dining room, a slim metal coat rack leans next to a narrow bench with a worn leather cushion, a small rolling utility cart with three mesh shelves sits beside the sideboard filled with condiments and jars, and a compact, cube-shaped mini fridge with a brushed metal finish is pushed under the sideboard. On the tabletop itself, a metal utensil caddy, a small wooden tray with salt and pepper grinders, a cluster of mismatched ceramic mugs, and a portable Bluetooth speaker create a cluttered, lived-in feel, with a canvas tote bag slung over the back of one chair and a folded step stool standing just behind the bar cart.
