This minimalist dining room features a long rectangular light oak dining table centered along the length of the space, surrounded by eight slim black metal-framed dining chairs with light gray upholstered seats, four on each long side and none at the ends. At one end of the room, a low white sideboard stands against the long axis, with a narrow black metal-framed console table positioned directly beside it, holding a simple ceramic bowl, a small rectangular black tray, and a tall clear glass carafe with a matching glass next to it. Along one long side, a slender open black metal shelving unit with three tiers holds a pair of white storage boxes, two small potted plants in plain gray planters, and a stack of neatly arranged white plates, while a minimalist black floor lamp with a slim stem and small round shade stands next to the shelves. On the opposite long side, a narrow bench with a light oak seat and black metal legs sits parallel to the table, accompanied by a small round black side table at one end, a single armless accent chair with a muted beige fabric seat facing the table, and a compact bar cart with two wooden shelves and metal frame holding three clear glass bottles, two wine glasses, and a small metal ice bucket, keeping the dining room organized and neat.
