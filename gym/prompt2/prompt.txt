This modern gym is arranged along the length of a narrow space, with equipment lined up neatly to keep circulation clear. At one end, a compact rubber-coated dumbbell rack holds a full set of black hex dumbbells, with an adjustable flat-to-incline weight bench positioned directly in front of it and a small metal utility stool tucked beside the bench. Parallel to the dumbbell area, a sleek black power rack with a chrome Olympic barbell stands next to a vertical weight-plate tree, and a low rolling storage cart with resistance bands, foam rollers, and small kettlebells is parked beside the rack. Further down the room, two matching black-and-silver treadmills stand side by side facing a wall-mounted flat-screen TV on a slim media console, with a modern stationary bike placed just next to the second treadmill and a compact rowing machine aligned directly behind the bike. At the far end, a firm folding exercise mat is laid out near a wooden plyometric box, with a freestanding metal coat and towel stand, a tall narrow shelving unit holding neatly stacked yoga blocks and folded towels, and a stainless steel water dispenser with a small side table for sports bottles completing the organized setup.
