This open-plan traditional-style gym features a central row of six black metal squat racks with matching barbell sets facing a line of three heavy-duty flat weight benches, with a pair of adjustable dumbbell racks in chrome and dark wood finish running parallel to them. In one corner, four classic wooden-framed cardio machines (two treadmills and two ellipticals) face a freestanding mirrored storage console, while a leather-upholstered Roman chair sits next to a vintage-style wooden plyometric box and a polished steel-and-wood kettlebell stand; nearby, a traditional wooden coat rack, a leather punching bag on a freestanding stand, a compact wooden towel cart with folded white towels, and a small, dark-wood refreshment table with a sleek metal water dispenser and stacked shaker bottles complete the cool, slightly futuristic look.
